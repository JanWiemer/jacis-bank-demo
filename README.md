# jacis-bank-demo
The typical example for transactions is transferring money from one account to antther. Therefore the sample application based on [Helidon.MP](https://helidon.io/docs/latest/#/mp/introduction/01_introduction) using the [JACIS](https://github.com/JanWiemer/jacis/wiki) project stores bank account balances.

Note that the maven file included in the project refers a maven repository hosted at gitHub: "https://maven.pkg.github.com/janwiemer/jacis". This repository requires an autentification with the user name "JanWiemer" and the proper password / token / githubPAT. This information is usually providedin maven settings file. An example maven configuration and the token / to use can be found in the [Installation chapter](https://github.com/JanWiemer/jacis/wiki/Installation) in the JACIS documentation.
